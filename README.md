# Comfyui-InfiniNode-Model-Suite üöÄ

Welcome to the **InfiniNode Model Suite**, a custom node pack for ComfyUI that transforms the process of manipulating generative AI models. Our suite is a direct implementation of the "GUI-Based Key Converter Development Plan," designed to remove technical barriers for advanced AI practitioners and integrate seamlessly with existing image generation pipelines.

The InfiniNode Model Suite is engineered as a definitive toolkit for model merging, customization, and optimization, empowering users to automate complex workflows and experiment directly within the ComfyUI environment.

## üîë Features at a Glance

The suite is divided into three core categories: Core I/O, StateDict Manipulation, and Advanced Merging. These nodes utilize PyTorch and the `safetensors` library for secure and high-performance operations.

### 1. Core I/O & Inspection Nodes

These nodes are the foundation for any model manipulation workflow, handling the loading, inspection, and saving of model data.

* **Load Model StateDict**: Loads a generative AI model file from disk into a `state_dict` object.
    * Supports `.safetensors` and legacy `.ckpt` formats.
    * Prioritizes `.safetensors` for superior security and performance.
    * Includes a `weights_only=True` toggle for secure loading of `.ckpt` files, mitigating risks from the `pickle` module.
    * Automatically handles nested `state_dict` keys.

* **Save Model StateDict**: Saves a modified `state_dict` object back to a file.
    * Outputs primarily to the recommended `.safetensors` format for security and efficiency.
    * Option to save to `.ckpt` for backward compatibility.
    * Allows users to select output precision between `fp32` (full) and `fp16` (half) to optimize for inference and VRAM usage.

* **Compare StateDicts & Gen-Keymap (InfiniNode)**: A utility node that serves as the starting point for any complex merge. It's designed to be the starting point for any complex merge. This node takes `state_dict_a` (source model) and `state_dict_b` (target model) as inputs. It outputs a `comparison_report` and a `keymap_template`. The `keymap_template` is a ready-to-use YAML-formatted string that can be copied, edited, and fed directly into the `Apply Keymap File` node.

### 2. StateDict Manipulation Nodes

These nodes act as surgical tools for renaming, pruning, and aligning model parameters.

* **Rename Keys**: Offers flexible methods for renaming keys within a `state_dict`.
    * **Simple Find/Replace**: Basic text fields for direct key name changes.
    * **Regex Support**: A toggle for advanced, pattern-based renaming.
    * **Preview Mode**: An option to output a text log of proposed changes without altering the `state_dict`.

* **Prune Keys**: Intelligently removes unwanted parameters to optimize model size and performance.
    * **Pattern-Based Pruning**: Uses text patterns (with regex support) to remove keys matching specific criteria, such as all optimizer states.
    * **Component Selection**: Checkboxes to easily remove entire architectural components like the VAE or Text Encoder.

* **Apply Keymap File**: Applies a complex set of renaming rules from an external `.json` or `.yaml` configuration file. This is essential for standardizing models or tackling obfuscated keys.

### 3. Advanced Merging Nodes

This is the core of the suite, providing access to sophisticated model merging algorithms.

* **Merge (Weighted Sum)**: Combines two or more models using a weighted average, which is ideal for blending different styles or aesthetics.

* **Merge (Add Difference)**: Implements "task arithmetic" to transfer a learned skill (or "task vector") from one model to another.

* **Merge (SLERP)**: Performs Spherical Linear Interpolation for a smoother, more geometrically sound merge, avoiding performance degradation often seen with linear interpolation.

* **Component Splitter / Combiner**: A set of utility nodes for deconstructing a model into its primary components and then reconstructing a new model from selected parts. This is essential for creating **hybrid models**.

## üí° Example: Hybrid Qwen-Image + SDXL Model

The following workflow demonstrates how the InfiniNode suite can combine the text rendering capabilities of Qwen-Image with the versatile image generation of SDXL.

1.  **Load Models**: Use two `Load Model StateDict` nodes to load `qwen-image.safetensors` and `sdxl-base.safetensors`.
2.  **Inspect & Align**: Connect both outputs to `Compare StateDicts & Gen-Keymap` nodes to observe key differences and generate a `keymap_template`. Use the **`Apply Keymap File`** node with a community-provided `qwen_to_sdxl.yaml` map to translate Qwen-Image's keys to an SDXL-compatible format. This addresses the core challenge of interoperability.
3.  **Split Components**: Use the **`Component Splitter`** node on both the aligned Qwen-Image state_dict and the SDXL state_dict.
4.  **Create Hybrid**: Take the Text Encoder output from the Qwen-Image splitter and the UNet and VAE outputs from the SDXL splitter. Feed these into a **`Component Combiner`** node.
5.  **Save Result**: Connect the output of the Component Combiner to a `Save Model StateDict` node to create a new hybrid model, such as `hybrid_qwen-sdxl_model.safetensors`, with potentially novel capabilities.
